- ## Hi, welcome to Logseq!
- Logseq is a *privacy-first*, *open-source* platform for *knowledge* management and collaboration.
- This is a 3 minute tutorial on how to use Logseq. Let's get started!
- Here are some tips might be useful.
- 1. Let's create a page called [[How to take dummy notes?]]. You can click it to go to that page, or you can `Shift+Click` to open it in the right sidebar! Now you should see both *Linked References* and *Unlinked References*.
- 2. Let's reference some blocks on [[How to take dummy notes?]], you can `Shift+Click` any block reference to open it in the right sidebar. Try making
  some changes on the right sidebar, those referenced blocks will be changed too!
	- Hello, I'm a block! : This is a block reference.
	- Hey, I'm another block! : This is another block reference.
- 3. Do you support tags?
	- Of course, this is a #dummy tag.
- 4. Do you support tasks like todo/doing/done and priorities?
	- Yes, type `/` and pick your favorite todo keyword or priority (A/B/C).
	- NOW [#A] A dummy tutorial on "How to take dummy notes?"
	- LATER [#A] Check out this awesome video by [:a {:href "https://twitter.com/TechWithEd" :target "_blank"} "@TechWithEd"], which shows how to use logseq to open your local directory.

	- DONE Create a page
	- CANCELED [#C] Write a page with more than 1000 blocks
